# Ciekawi Historii?
> A simple website created using jQuery, Bootstrap and Firebase.

## About the project
*Ciekawi Historii? / Curious about History?* Is the first project that attempts to gather together the obtained information on HTML, JavaScript and CSS, as part of the postgraduate studies *Junior Web Developer*. The project is a web portal that allows you to view and publish articles describing historical curiosities.

* Search for articles by tags, titles and authors,
* The ability to add articles for logged in users,
* Option to create an account as part of the portal along with:
     * basic user account support (changing username, email address, password),
     * reset forgotten password,
     * deleting the account from the portal,
     * add, edit, delete and view your own articles.
* Contact form.
